# Colfax Ops
Homelab Git Ops on Kubernetes.

## Getting A Fresh Build
This virtual Kubernetes build consists of a 1 machine running Proxmox with 15 cores and 48 gigs of
ram. This machine will be split into 3 VMs, 1 control plane and 2 worker nodes. These virtual
machines will be managed with terraform and ansible.
Eventually another worker node will be added through Vagrant and managed through ansible as well.

### Cluster Build Steps
Much of the initial cluster setup has been modified from this repo, but updated for more modern
versions of Kubernetes and modified Ansible playbooks.

Configuration

 - Run `virtual-k8s/promox-k8s/proxmox/terraform` against Promox server, setting up 1 
   control-plane and 2 worker nodes. The apply takes about 4.5 minutes.

   ℹ️ **Note**
   - In the Terraform [variables](virtual-k8s/proxmox-k8s/proxmox/terraform/variables.tf) file, 
    you'll want to update the the variables here with connection info to your Proxmox api.

   - You also may want to change IP address and the virtual machine specs in the 
    [main.tf](virtual-k8s/proxmox-k8s/proxmox/terraform/main.tf) file to suit your needs.

   In the [virtual-k8s/proxmox-k8s/proxmox/terraform/](virtual-k8s/proxmox-k8s/proxmox/terraform/) 
   directory, run the following.
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```
 - Once the Terraform apply completes we'll need to setup the Ansible inventory with the nodes we
   created via Terraform. [virtual-k8s/proxmox-k8s/](virtual-k8s/proxmox-k8s/ansible/inventory.yaml)
 - This will install kubeadm and other utilities necisarry for standing up the cluster. From the
   [virtual-k8s/proxmox-k8s/proxmox/](virtual-k8s/proxmox-k8s/proxmox/) directory run the following.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory.yaml ansible/bootstrap.yaml -K
   ```
   ℹ️ *Note:* Pull the generated kubeconfig stored as `admin.conf`
   
- Install MetalLB through ansible, for whatever reason this works better than anything else. MetalLB
  allows us to establish an IP range we can later use as `LoadBalancer`` IP addresses.
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory.yaml ansible/metallb.yaml -K
  ```
- Install Kube Seal, follow the [README.me](cluster/bedrock/kube-seal/README.md)
- Installed ArgoCD, follow the [README.me](cluster/argocd/README.md).
